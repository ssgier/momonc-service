TODO:
- explicit white background?
- get impression of user experience by running soft-npu evolution (perhaps use cpp impl)
- add notes on suitabile objective functions (expensive, single threaded)
- diagnostics widget to display stderr out and failed run info with cmd to reproduce/debug
- serialize/deserialize state for saving progress
- accept only localhost, handle disconnects on the ui side
- thoroughly validate all inputs (like stdev >= 0, or inf/nan in jsons)
